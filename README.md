Everyone needs their own little spot on the interwebs, and this is mine.  
**Welcome to my Website Portfolio!**

## Visit the Website

To check out the live version of the site in all of it's glory, head over to:

## Technology

### [GatsbyJS](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/)

Gatsby is a free and open source framework based on React that helps developers build blazing fast websites and apps.

### [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)

A utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom designs. Tailwind CSS is a highly customizable, low-level CSS framework that gives you all of the building blocks you need to build bespoke designs

## Building from Source

Since the project has been set up with Gatsby, the build process has become easier than ever.
**Just follow the steps to get started:**

1. Make sure you have Node/NPM installed on your computer, then run the following commands:

```console
npm install -g gatsby-cli
```

2. Clone the repository and go into the working directory

```console
git clone https://github.com/AmruthPillai/ResumeOnTheWeb-Gatsby.git
cd ResumeOnTheWeb-Gatsby
```

3. Then, just run this command to install the necessary dependencies. It might take a while for it to finish, so keep an episode of 'Friends' running, just in case.

```console
npm install
```

4. Watch the project come to life by firing up a server, brought to you by `gatsby-cli` which you installed in Step 1

```console
gatsby develop
```

5. If you want to build the application in production, just make use of `gatsby-cli` again

```console
gatsby build
```
