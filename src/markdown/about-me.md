Hey there!

I'm Trupti Nayak, and as you might have already read, I'm a Full stack Javascript developer, Designer and photographer. This website was made to showcase all of what I can do and plan to do. 

I got into design because I consider myself a pseudo-perfectionist, if that's even a word? As in, I hate to see things 'not look good'. So I set out on a journey to make products that people use that 'look great', and I'm forever on that path.

I got into development because computers have always fascinated me. The things we use regularly, like Facebook or Amazon, was no less than magic to me and that's where my quest to invent began.

I created this website so I could showcase some of my work and through this process, make it easier for you to connect with me. If you like what you see, get in touch with me. Send me an email at truptipai95@gmail.com. I would love to hear from you!
