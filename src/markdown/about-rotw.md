**Resume on the Web** has been a project that I've been focused on since the early 2014s. I didn't want my information to be displayed on just a sheet of paper that only HRs or Talent Scouts had the privilege of reading, I wanted it to be accessible to everyone. And that's how this project was conceptualized.

I constantly update it to match who I am, because just like this website, I don't have a static personality. I use the latest technologies and use this platform to challenge myself into learning new frameworks, new build tools, experiment with new design ideas while keeping the core principle of getting to know me as simple as possible.
